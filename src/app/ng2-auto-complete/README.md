## Origin

This module is a lightly modified version of [ng2-auto-complete](https://github.com/ng2-ui/ng2-auto-complete).

Currently tracking [ng2-auto-complete@0.5.5](https://github.com/ng2-ui/ng2-auto-complete/tree/0.5.5)

It has been modified to append the authentication header when querying the server, and to add the `[value-formatter]` configuration option. This allows formatting the display string in the input box after a selection has been made.
